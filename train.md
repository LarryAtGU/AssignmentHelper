## Assignment Specification: Milestone 1

### Assignment Title: Enhanced Tetris Game Development

### Submission: Milestone 1

### Due Date: End of Week 5 (25/08/2024)

### Objective

The primary objective of this assignment is to utilize Software Engineering principles and the Java programming language to develop an enhanced version of the classic Tetris game. This milestone will focus on the initial development stages, ensuring a solid foundation for the final product.

### Background

Tetris is a classic puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. The game involves players manipulating tetrominoes, shapes composed of four square blocks each, which descend onto a playing field. The goal is to fit these shapes into complete rows, which then disappear, earning points for the player. The game ends when the tetrominoes stack up to the top of the playing field and no more shapes can enter.

### General Functions

To understand the general requirements and functionalities expected in the enhanced Tetris game, please study the provided demo video. This will give you a comprehensive understanding of the gameplay mechanics, user interface, and additional features required for your implementation.

### Submission

The submission for this milestone is a Word or PDF document based on the template provided on the course website. The document must include the following:

1. **GitHub Project Link**:

   - Provide the link to your GitHub project repository.
   - Ensure that you have invited the course convenor to your project so they can access it:
     - GC students, please ask Elizabeth for her GitHub account.
     - Online and Nathan students, please add `LarryAtGU` as a team member in your GitHub project.

2. **Demo Video Link**:
   - Include a link to a video that demonstrates your game.
   - Detailed instructions for the video will be provided later in this specification.

**Note:** Each group only needs to make one submission. A student in the group will submit the document on behalf of the entire group.

**Requirements**:

- **Pause Functionality**:

  - Pressing the P button should pause the game, stopping all tetromino movement.
  - When the game is paused, display a message on the field indicating that the game is paused and instructing the player to press P again to continue.

  - **No**: Returns to the main screen.

### FAQ

Q: What programming language should we use?
A: You should use Java for this assignment.

Q: How many studnets in one group?
A: A group can have up to 5 students, as this is a group project, we encourage students to work in groups as it provides a more real project like environments. However, for students who want to work alone, they can enrol in one person groups.

Q: Can students from different course codes and/or from different labs to work in a group
A: We encouage students from the same lab to form groups as it will be more convinent for the students to work for the assignment, however, we do allow mixed groups for the maximum benefits of the students.

Q: If I can't complete the assignment on time, what should I do.
A: The university has detailed policy related to late submission. However, if you find you can't finish the assignment on time, you should ask for an extension. You can apply extension through the university's extension application link or you can contact the convenors through teams or email to apply for extension. Either way is fine.

Q: To whom should I contact if I need help.
A: For questions related to the course contents, please send your question to Larry (l.wen@griffith.edu.au). For management questions such as change labs or apply extension, GC students please contact Elizabeth (e.chang@griffith.edu.au), Online and Nathan students please contact Larry. You can send email or chat through Teams. For general questions without personal issues, you are encouraged to post your questions in the teams general channel.

Q: How many submissions required for a group?
A: One group only need to make one submission by a student from the group.

Q: If I work alone, how do I domonstate group meeting.
A: Some assessment items related to multiple students in a group are not appliable for students work alone. For those assessment items, the students work alone don't need to demonstrate them, maybe just write N/A in the submission under those items, and they will not lose marks on those items.

Q: Can I draw multiple activity diagram if one diagram is too complex.
A: Yes, you can, make sure to make the connection between your diagrams are clear, and remember to following UML notation for activity diagram and use swimlanes.

### Remarks

If students ask for examples of functional requirements, please give them no more than three examples.

For functionl requirements, please stress the consistency of terminology, use the same term refer the same concept. Don't use main screen in some functional requirements, then use main menu screen in other requirements, if main screen and main meun screen mean the same screen.

Any number of students in the group can narrate the demo video.

For questions if you don't know how to answer, please ask the students to ask Larry (l.wen@griffith.edu.au)
